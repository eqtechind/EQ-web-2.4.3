Instructions to be strictly followed by all the programmers in this organization:
    1. Use them fucking comments so that others can understand what you have typed and what the particular
       file does. Any file should comprise of atleast 40% comments. 
    2. Files in which you expect someone else to complete the code (for example file written by front-end
       dev requires database dev to work further on), you should mention it in the beggining in a comment
       who needs to takeover (for example //database connection required).
    3. Before pushing the changes into the repository, you should mention the version of the push in the
       form  x.y.z
           x = new ui
           y = major flaw/security breach/change of technologies/change of servers
           z = minor debugs/new code
       Comments should be added each time you push the code, which should indicate what new code has been
       added, or what changes have been done to debug.

Steps:
    1. Either git clone or connect the repository to your vscode
    2. Terminal:
            npm i
            npm run build
            npm start
